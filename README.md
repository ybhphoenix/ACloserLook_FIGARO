model.sp:
One example of the gate-level model, corresponding to the feedback polynomial f(x)=x^15+x^14+x^6+x^3+x+1.

original-data.xlsx:
The original data measured from FPGA implementation, which is divided into three categories: continuous periodic oscillation, intermittent periodic oscillation and chaotic oscillation. The binary challenges, min-entropy, Lyapunov exponents and the numbers of different states in 10000 samples are included in this file.

python code:
The python script to implement the proposed algorithm to select a suitable feedback polynomial.
